This file does the following:

overlayPinConfig.sh - this is a script that is run by the user before launching the main program. It does the following: loads the univeral IO and HDMI-disabling device tree overlays (sometimes referred to synonymously with capes); loads the UIO_PRUSS kernel driver and sets aside 2MB of system memory for use by the PRUs; configures all the pins necessary for PRU input, output, and UART; and configures one pin for PWM to drive the camera.

To use this file:

copy overlayPinConfig.sh to whatever directory you will be working from and make executable

Before running the main BioloidBeaglebone program, you must execute the overlayPinConfig.sh (e.g. open a terminal window, switch to the directory where you placed overlayPinConfig.sh, type ./overlayPinConfig.sh, and press enter). This only needs to be done once, and should only be done once, preferrably right after booting has completed. You should also run GRB422-QVGA.sh from the CameraManipulationScripts folder if you are using the GRB422 QVGA version of the camera code, currently the default. This must be run after overlayPinConfig.sh or it will not work.
